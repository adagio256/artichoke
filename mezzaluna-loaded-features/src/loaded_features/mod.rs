//! A set to track loaded Ruby source paths based on a [`Vec`] and [`HashSet`].

//! Ruby tracks which files and native extensions have been [required] in a

//! `$LOADED_FEATURES` is an Array of paths which point to these Ruby sources

/// A set of all sources loaded by a Ruby interpreter with [`require`] and

///
/// In Ruby, when loading files with `require` and `require_relative`, the
/// constants defined in them have global scope. Ruby keeps track of loaded
/// sources in its interpreter state to ensure files are not `require`'d
/// multiple times.
///
/// Ruby refers to files tracked in this way as _features_. The set of loaded
/// features are stored in a global variable called `$LOADED_FEATURES`, which is
/// aliased to `$"`.

/// `$LOADED_FEATURES` is an append only set. Disk-based features are
/// deduplicated by their real position on the underlying file system (i.e. their
/// device and inode).
